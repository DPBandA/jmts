## Things to do
### PENDING LIVE DATABASE ALTERATIONS:
- Add: discount, discountType, paymentTerms to CASHPAYMENT table
- Rename: rename JMTSUserId to userId in CASHPAYMENT??
- Add: BILLINGADDRESS_ID, CONTACT_ID to Job table (for billing address, contact)
- Add: country to Address dialog?
- Add: System Option organizationName, Bureau of Standards Jamaica, String, 
       GENERAL, The name of this organization.
- Update: Deactivate records that have "--" so they do not appear in autocomplete
  and select components.
- Add: System options: applicationHeading and applicationSubheading
- Add System options: defaultUsername, defaultPassword
- Check that all users are authenticated on the live JMTS.
================================================================================
### Rebuild UI Functionality
- Impl Clients as tab and use the current client dialog for the content.
  * Make "active" column editable using the technique used for classification.
- Implement generating service contact form.
- Do shallow copy of client, billing address and contact before saving job to 
  ensure that future edits of the client's name, billing address and contact
  do not affect the job record.
- Delete blank users, dept and employee etc. from database.
- Test and fix up repot dialog if needed.
- Format the search button and text for tabs as is done with the employees tab.
- Remove units from the user menu when when they are deselected in the preferences.

### Immediate Issues
- The client owner should be set to the client manager's client when the client 
  is "oked". 
  Impl. handling of saving and closing client dialog. 
  After adding an address or contact the respective address and contact fields
  are to be updated. 
- <p:autoComplete id="currentClientBillingAddress"> should be validated. Validation
  must coonsider the case when the address is new and does not exist in the database.
- Put use <p:ajax event="dialogReturn"> to update fields and use primefaces 
  dialog framework for the client form/dialog.
- Finish NewClientValidator and use it to validate new client entries. Impl. 
  prevention dialog closing and client save until client is validated like 
  what is done for the system option dialog.
  Try remove <p:dialog> may be that will make it behave like the systemOptionDialogForm.
- Ensure "Entered by" and "Edited by" works.
- Implement "Select/Add contact" 
- Imlement "+ New" to be put beside "Select/Add Contact/Address" in client form.
- Setup UI for entry and display of billing address for new and existing client.
   The current UI is not user friendly.
- Call getBillingAddress(), getMainContact() when client is first selected in 
   job client field. 
- Remove code that changes the billing address type to only one address. ie allow
   more than one address to bear the "billing" type.
- Validate address fields in address dialog.
- Remove type and "set billing addres" from client dialog and fix fact that
   table is not properly update or stateOrProvince not being set.
- Find address using all fields of the address and use autocomplete and validate
  billing address before save. Create a validator that show errors warns about using
  comma in an address field and ensure that all fields are filled out.
- Implement change back to billing address and implement search on all the fields
   of a address for use in the converter.
- Use POJOs where possible on ClientForm.
- Implement billing address field on job dialog. Fill in billing address after
   address is selected in "select billing address combobox.
- Implement validators where necessary.
- Add contact field in "General" tab. Make it autocomplete with drop down and 
   force selection. Add edit button beside field. Allow setting the contacts address
   as the billing address if no billing address is set on the main client. 
- In Job.validate() check for id == null instead where possible instead of fetching the object.
- Implement updateCashPayment() to record updates made to a field and store the updates.
- Make sure service contract, job costing etc. are updated to use the billing address
  and contact found in the job record.
in a list called updates using a method called update() in JobManager. 
Only mark the job as dirty when the dialog is closed or "oked". 
JobManager isDirty should be not be set to true if edits in a dialog have been 
canceled. Implement same feature for the JobDialog and other dialogs.
- Add cash payments feature so cashier can add cash payments.
* Add discount type and discount to cash payment form.
* Add fields to cashPayment and database: discount, discountType, 
paymentTerms, rename JMTSUserId to userId
* Make a payment(first) as desosit and save to jobCostingAndPayment.deposit
* Add PO number to payment panel. 
* Update corresponding fields in jobCostingAndPayment as required.
* Use canEditInvoicingAndPayment where necessary
* Ensure amount due is updated correctly using cash payments.
- Create contact field in the job record to assign contact to current job.
- Implement and include report templates for all reports generated to date.
- Implement prevention of the insertion of incorrect subcontract jobs costing 
amounts which sometimes occur when the date of submission of a parent job is changed
- Modify the permissions scheme to prevent the changing of some fields (such as 
the client field) by unauthorized personnel and track all changes made.  
- Implement "Double View" for the cashier so that the Cashier and Job Costing 
Views can be viewed simultaneously for easy job costing updates.
-- Create views/tabs for job costing and cashier instead of using job tables view. 
    OR
-- Instead of creating double view, "merge" the columns from "Job Costing" 
view while leaving out unneeded columns.
- Implement BSJ client entry update and automatic contact detail insertion when 
subcontracting jobs.
-- For external jobs, create contact field in job record and store contact from 
a selected client contact.
-- For subcontracts, get or create contact for person doing the subcontract.
- Use primefaces Dialog framework to implement all dialogs so they can be reused
by other apps?
- Remove payeeFirst/Lastname and put contact/person.
- Remove search parameters for legal, compliance and foods.
- When subcontracted department is deleted and the job form is closed,
  the subcontracted department field disappears when the form is reopened. Fix!
- This was commented out of ClientManager: 
    //getMain().displayCommonMessageDialog(null, "Please provide at least 1 character for the search text.", "Insufficient Characters", "alert");
    Find way to get something like this back in without using getMain().
- For new clients make sure that the "EnteredBy" field is filled out.
- If the billing address field is not set then set the default billing address
  for the client being edited.
- Do copy of billing address, contact and client before saving new job. Do
  not allow changing these fields except by sysadmin. Implement doShallowCopy()
  for client that does not copy the list of addresses and contacts.
- Prevent changing of all fields that affect the service contract.
- Put sys option that controls the changing auto job number generation. Make it
  unchangeable by default.

#### Monthly Report
• # of weighing and measuring devices (what are the devices?) were targeted for verifications during the period under review (break out the devices into various categories and state the numbers for each category). Do not include # of calibrations in the number of verifications (state the difference). 
• # of premises visited for the purposes of testing and verifying weighing and measuring devices.
• # of weighing and measuring devices that were tested and verified during the period under review.
• % of those tested and verified that were in compliance with related metrological requirements?
• # of investigations of suspected inaccurate measurements were conducted? (it is assumed that these investigations were as a result of complaints received from consumers and businesses who believed that they had received inaccurate measurements)
• Types of weighing and measuring devices were these investigations conducted and the results of the investigations. 
• # of gas pump stickers that were issued during this financial year. # issued during the corresponding period last financial year.

13) Check if food inspection forms have been merged.

### Status & Tracking
- Status note field needs to be locked and a button be used to add updates to it. These updates would be added as new line (i.e. \n). And updates can therefore only be added but not deleted.
- Remove dateCostingCompleted, dateCostingApproved, depositDate, dateOfLastPayment and costingDate from where they should not because they are all in jobStatusAndTracking. Make sure they are not being used first.
- Steps to be tracked: (i) dispatch date to client (ii) delivery of report/sample to customer service (iii) assignment of job by team leader (iv) date customer was contacted (v) date email sent to client when job is completed. (vi) re-issue of report.

### Accpac Integration
- Add option to change days to add to invoice date to get invoice due date.

25) Add all tables/fields to boshrmapp mysql and deploy. Check: ComplianceSurvey, ProductInpsection etc. 
26) Add product type. Find out the standard product types from Inspectorate and ISO.
27) Add validation to all tabs. Eg if “detention request issued” is checked, make sure job number is valid. In other words make sure that all values required for the generation of forms are entered and valid.
28) Make sure system options and report records are on the boshrmapp mysql server. 
29) Check to make sure the number of samples is being exported on the relevant forms as required.

38) Should port of entry reason for detention be separate from domestic market reason?
39) Add fields for detention and release numbers and use in forms. Do generation of numbers when survey is being saved. Use the format given in the procedure.
40) When a pdf form is generated, make sure the required *Issued field is set to true and the relevant release/detention number generated.
41) Detention release number should separate from detention number. Stick to number format as given in procedure.
42) Should inspector number (eg BSJ-07-22) be used instead of inspector name as is done for notice of detention? Consult on this.

- Implement editing report details in "System Admin"
- Check on monthly report date periods for duplicates. Note that “This financial year” is not there.
- “Jobs in Period” report not working so fix it.
- Create interface to upload report files to “jasperrreports” or the folder that is designated as the reports folder in system options.
- For report data use left join to get jobs that don't have samples.
- Implement "Earning Parent Jobs Only" search type and make in default for the Finance department.
- Add date costing prepared as a date search field in Cashier View
- Use Dynamic Columns to create views and allow persons to choose any set of columns.
- Find way to save/close job costing and maintain selections in cashier/costing views.
- Need to be able to use the search area in system admin section to search for partial string in any field, not only the name. I may need to list all users from chemistry for examples, thus, i would need to search for chemistry and all users in chemistry would show up in the list.
- Create report that shows workload per staff.
- Create links to report in report tab in job detail dialog.
- Implement "Advanced Search" configuration using a database table and not in hard code as is done now. Call table SearchConfigurations or SearchParameters?

### General
- Get favicon. Green box sample was created as place holder. Real real one to be created.
- Implement tip o the day
- Generate and send emails in thread NB: Implemented but to be tested directly on BSJ and not thru VPN.

### Department Management (Generic ERP)
- Ensure that only "activate" depart are retrieved or created to avoid the creation of multiple departments with the same name.
- Check if new departments are being created by the LegalDocumentPortal.
- Add feature to add/remove employees from departments.

### Job Entry & Update
#### Issues
- Validate the sample dialog info before closing it.
- When blank business office is selected and job saved the no message comes up. Fix!!
- Automatically add the person sub contracting a job as the contact person
- Add contact field to job. If not contact is assigned, assign the "main" contact to the job. Update service contract, job costing etc to reflect this.
- Add field for sample condition.
- User is asked to save job when job dialog is closed even when its saved. Fix.
- Prevent job from being marked uncompleted once completed.
- "Completed" most be removed by authorized person before a job can be edited.
- Implement sample copying inside sample dialog.
- Limit the number of samples/products that can be entered into sample/product quantity. Use system option for this.
- See how “retest jobs” can be handled without turning off auto job numbering.
- Make country of origin autocomplete in job sample dialog.
- Find why business office is being marked as in active. Check if done during job entry or update
- Look at the code in validateCurrentJob that deals with subcontracted department. Is it necessary to do all that check or just set it to "--" if it is null? May be false should never be returned.
- Find way to let cashier do all she needs to do in just the cashier view. Find out details from Cherrian.
- Implement assigning job to person only if they are in the department/subcontracted department for the job.
- When one attempts to mark a job without a final cost switch back work progress to the stored work progress?
- Job Modified dialog takes a while to go away when "no" is pressed and does not show the "busy" icon. When "yes' button is pressed "busy" icon shows and the dialog is dismissed fairly quickly
- Add TAT to expected start when job is entered???
- Job can be marked "unapproved" while it is still completed. Fix!
- Don't make TAT mandatory for non-earning job.
- Implement adding multiple sectors to one job.
- Implement job copying.
- Implement locking of opened job and alert others that it's opened. Implement some form of push notification.
- Make sure parent job is not marked completed until child job is complete.
- See if entering deactivated departments can be prevented.
- Turnaround time given to client should show error if input is not a number. Also, that turnaround time number could be added to submission date upon first save but remains editable just in case.
#### Process for job entry
1. Request form is filled out and submitted through the website. This data would go straight to the database.
2. Notification system designed to signal creation of proforma which would pull data already in the system from the request form. 
3. Database to interact with ACCPAC to signal payment or go ahead for job to be done if credit customer.
4. Necessary data transferred to the itinerary which can be viewed on the handheld device.
5. Once at the location, certain fields could automatically be populated on the field report instead of re-entering data already in the system.
6. The necessary verification checks (capacity and serial numbers for example) would be done and additional data (test results) entered.
7. Notification to be sent for certificates and job costing to be done which I thought would be as easy as a few clicks of the mouse since all the data would already be in the system/database.

### Customer Relation Management (GenericERP)
- Allow add/edit of contact or client separately based on privilege and don't make a copy of the client as is current done.
- Implement cancel adding contact and address in dialog.
- Make sure job costing and service contract uses job billing address and the contact assigned to the job and NOT the client main contact.
- Ensure that overseas clients are not charged GCT. Indicate with field in client table. If the main/billing address is changed to something other than "local" the change client to international. Show alert when this is done?
- Implement 'Main' phone number as is done for 'Main' contact.
- Make TRN mandatory for local clients?
- Add country to address/contact details/record.
- Address type for newly added address does not change when selected in table. Fix!
- Enforce entry of certain data if not credit customer. Determine this data.

### Human Resource Management (GenericERP)
- Check out why employees with blank names are being created. The blank employees are linked to jobs so look for clues in the job creation and update process. Look at all senarios where an
- employee could be created. check if creating a new user causes this.
- Dont let newly created employees be active except when created via system admin.
- Delete blank internet and business office created linked to blank employees? Ensure that only "activate" employees are retrieved or created
- Implement assigning a person to more than one department.

### Accounting/Financial Services
- Allow anyone in department to mark costing as prepared/completed.
- Prevent creating invoices for child jobs.
- Implement cash payments and use of "get total payments received" and not getDeposit for "Total paid".
- Put close button on upper right of costing dialog.
- At the bottom of the summary section in costing show the names of who approved and who invoiced.
- Add feature to show/hide child jobs from showing in tables specifically for finance. Make it a per user preference.
- Change jobCostingAndPayment.deposit to jobCostingAndPayment.paid and the corresponding database filed? Same for deposit date?
- Job Details on costing needs to pull info from instructions (i.e. special instructions section). Export instructions and not special instructions to contract. Done – instructions are joined with special instructions for now. I suggest that the be properly done when the new form is implemented.
- Check job is marked dirty under all circumstances when payment info is edited.
- Do this to figure out why payment and may be costing info is not being saved.
- GCT to be added only to parent jobs. update all relevant fields when costing is updated.
- Set date costing prepared to cost date in the report for now.
- Allow marking a non-earning job as completed even with $0.00 final cost.
- Receipt, discount and invoice number are editable by non-finance staff? Change if so.
- Apply discount to estimated and final cost. Allow applying fixed and percentage cost.
- Implement option to turn off the charging of tax such as GCT for specific departments.
- Disable invoicing if job is "not earning" and/or user is not from finance.
- Remove the costing date when costing is "disapproved".
- Job costings for subcontracted jobs are being pulled into the costing of other jobs because the year the job was submitted is being changed. Could be solved by preventing the job number and date submitted from being changed manually.
- Append credit terms to payment terms? Get confirmation from Finance.
- Implement setting currency and exchange rates for costing payments.
- Put isdirty in job costing and payment and only save when it is dirty. Only Finance personnel or other designated persons should be able to change invoicing and payment fields by implementing cash payments.
- Add option to remove or include child job costings.
- Dept 52 (standards) should charge GCT of 2% by default. Add "Default GCT" as a setting
- in the department detail...add a tab called "Adanced Options" with a field called "Default GCT" and move "Apply taxes to job costing" privilege to that tab.
- Dynamically add 16.5% gct to labels. Check that job costing shows the correct percentage that is applied.
- Prevent job costing approval for jobs without a report number?
- Disable "approve checkbox" if person is not dept supervisor or person authorized to approve., invoiced.
- Allow setting min. deposit as percentage or fixed cost. #15
- NB (Put in Wiki): The job costing template is : c:\jasperreports\Job Costing.jasper

### Database management
- Implement quick and advanced search for data lists.
- Remove excess classification entries for "Non-Earning - Internal Client Request" and "--". NB Check what is causing them to be created.
- Find all entities that references the current entity before deleting. try with employee and client for example. create interface for this.
- Remove fields from database that are not used: jobcostingandpayment: depositDate, jobcostingandpayment: dateOfLastPayment
